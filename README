SYNOPSIS

     use PERLANCAR::Home::Dir qw(get_my_home_dir);
    
     my $dir = get_my_home_dir();

DESCRIPTION

    This is a (temporary?) module to get user's home directory. It is a
    lightweight version of File::HomeDir with fewer OS support (only
    Windows and Unix) and fewer logic/heuristic.

VARIABLES

 $DIE_ON_FAILURE => bool (default: 0)

    If set to true, will die on failure. Else, function usually return
    undef on failure.

FUNCTIONS

    None are exported by default, but they are exportable.

 get_my_home_dir() => str

    Try several ways to get home directory. Return undef or die (depends on
    $DIE_ON_FAILURE) if everything fails.
